Project Status updates / Questions

Worked on both tables and driver file. 
Latest output:

 ----jGRASP exec: java HashTesting
Input file exists. Reading...

Total collisions for Single Hash table: 459
With a file of 200 inputs, that equals
an average of 2.295 collisions per attempt.

Total collisions for Double Hash table: 245
With a file of 200 inputs, that equals
an average of 1.225 collisions per attempt.

 ----jGRASP: operation complete.
 
 Looks like it matches the output he gave us in class when he explained the project :)
